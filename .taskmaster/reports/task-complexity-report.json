			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Next.js Project with Core Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project setup into: 1) Initial project creation and TypeScript setup, 2) Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui configuration, 3) Core dependencies installation (React Hook Form, Zod, TanStack Query, next-intl), 4) Supabase client configuration with anonymous auth, and 5) Project structure setup and development tooling (ESLint, Prettier).",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple technology integrations and configuration requirements. Each dependency has specific setup requirements that could fail independently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Supabase Database Schema and RLS Policies",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the database setup into: 1) Create tutoring_records table with proper constraints, 2) Create contributors table with relationships, 3) Implement Row Level Security policies for data access control, 4) Setup anonymous authentication configuration, 5) Create database functions for statistics calculations with SECURITY DEFINER, and 6) Test and validate all security policies and constraints.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to security-critical RLS policies, database function creation, and the need for proper data access controls. Database security mistakes can have serious consequences."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Anonymous Session Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down session management into: 1) Implement anonymous session creation with Supabase auth, 2) Create session context and React hooks for state management, 3) Implement secure cookie handling and session persistence, and 4) Create utility functions for contribution status and session cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to security considerations around session management, cookie handling, and state persistence across browser sessions. Authentication flows can be tricky to implement correctly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Create Data Submission Form with Validation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide form creation into: 1) Create form component structure with all required fields and dropdowns, 2) Implement Zod validation schema with comprehensive error handling, 3) Integrate React Hook Form for state management and validation, and 4) Add UI polish with error states, success feedback, and privacy messaging.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with multiple form fields, validation rules, and user experience considerations. Form validation and error handling require careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Record Submission API and Database Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down API implementation into: 1) Create API route structure with proper request/response handling, 2) Implement server-side validation using Zod schemas, 3) Create database operations for contributor upsert and record insertion with atomic transactions, and 4) Add comprehensive error handling and logging for observability.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to database transactions, error handling, and the critical nature of data submission. Atomic operations and proper validation are essential."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Build Data Explorer with Filtering and Statistics",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide data explorer into: 1) Create FilterBar component with all filter options, 2) Implement StatsCard components for statistical displays, 3) Build RecordsTable with anonymized data display, 4) Integrate TanStack Query for data fetching and caching, and 5) Add responsive design and loading/error states.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to multiple interactive components, data fetching optimization, and responsive design requirements. Statistics display and filtering logic add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Statistics and Records API Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down API endpoints into: 1) Create /api/get-stats endpoint with access control checks, 2) Implement /api/get-records endpoint with anonymization, 3) Add query parameter validation and filtering logic, 4) Optimize database queries for performance targets, and 5) Implement comprehensive error handling and RLS enforcement.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to performance requirements (P95 < 250ms), access control enforcement, and query optimization. Database performance and security are critical."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Create Unlock Gate and Access Control UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide unlock gate into: 1) Create UnlockGate component with blurred preview functionality, 2) Implement lock symbols and messaging for non-contributors, 3) Add smooth unlock transition and PrivacyCallout component, and 4) Ensure both client-side UX and server-side security enforcement.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with UI/UX considerations and security enforcement. The visual effects and state transitions require careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Observability and Event Logging",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down observability into: 1) Create /api/log-event endpoint with privacy-safe logging, 2) Implement client-side event tracking hooks, 3) Add performance metrics and query timing, and 4) Create dashboard queries for internal monitoring while ensuring no PII is captured.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on logging and monitoring. Privacy considerations and performance metrics add some complexity but the core functionality is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize UI/UX, Accessibility, and Performance Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide finalization into: 1) Implement responsive mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS, 2) Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML), 3) Optimize images and implement lazy loading, 4) Configure security headers and anti-CSRF measures, 5) Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting, and 6) Run Lighthouse audits and achieve performance targets.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple optimization areas including accessibility, performance, security, and responsive design. Lighthouse score requirements add measurable complexity."
